    <h4>Challenges Marketplace is a financial data management platform that serves both SMEs and their
      potential investors. Challenges Marketplace enables SMEs to gather,
      manage, and analyze their own data, including the monthly and
      annual financial data that investors expect to see. Additionally, the platform provides a
      visualization dashboard for the CEO and management team to see all their key metrics in one place.
      Harvard’s management guru Peter Drucker says:“you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” This dashboard
      will help SME managers—who often have limited financial and data analysis processes— better understand and manage
      their businesses. Moreover, the platform helps those SMEs who are ready for equity or debt investment
      to show their best side to potential investors that they select. </h4>

    <h4>In addition to serving the SMEs, Challenges Marketplace serves potential investors by providing them
      with a clear and standardized view of each company’s finances and other metrics. The platform enables
      investors to easily see SME data so that they can screen companies and
      choose which to focus on for further due diligence. For the first time, investors have access to SME data
      in developing countries so that they can diversify their
      investment portfolio and invest in socially responsible small businesses.</h4>

    <h5><u>Additions to Marketplace:</u> Over time, we expect to add additional functionality to Marketplace, such as
      our proprietary ratings system. We will also offer consulting services to companies to help them fix
      problems in their business and thus improve their metrics and their [diagnostic data] so they can be
      more attractive to investors.</h5>
